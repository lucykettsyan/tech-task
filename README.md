## Important Comments By Lusine :)

Please be aware that there are some imperfections in the code, in particular related to logging and exception handling, lack of docstrings and comments, lack of unit tests...These were left out on purpose because of the time constraints I had (due to heavy schedule), so I would really appreciate your understanding when it comes to these criteria.

The task is done using Laravel, React, Inertia.js
